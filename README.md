# Multimodal-Data-Processing-Analysis-Reddit-data (Dutch)
Multimodal Reddit Data Processing Pipeline for text, image and audio analysis.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on collecting, processing, and analyzing multimodal data from Reddit, including text, images, and audio/video content. The goal is to build a data pipeline that extracts, cleans, and transforms raw data into structured formats suitable for further analysis and machine learning tasks.

The project combines API data collection, web scraping, image and audio processing, and natural language processing techniques.

## Project Components

- Data collection using Reddit API and web scraping
- Image preprocessing (Gaussian blur, grayscale conversion, OCR)
- Audio extraction and cleaning with speech-to-text transcription
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Multimodal feature engineering for content analysis
- Structured storage of processed data in a relational database (SQLite)

## Tools & Libraries

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Selenium, PRAW, OpenCV, Librosa, SpeechRecognition, FFmpeg, scikit-image, SQLite, Matplotlib

## Results

The pipeline successfully processes multimodal Reddit data and prepares structured datasets for further analysis, enabling sentiment analysis, toxicity detection, and content exploration across text, image, and audio sources.
